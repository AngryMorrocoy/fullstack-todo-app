# FullStack TODO-APP

Hey, I built this app inspired by this
[challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW/hub/todo-app-Ix9H1k_sKo)
in frontend mentor.

## The backend

The backend is built (well, the whole app) using **django**, **DRF** for the api
and **dj-rest-auth** for the authentication in all the app.


For the authentication I decided to use **JWT** and cookies to maintain the
session in the browser, but still using json web tokens.

## The frontend

All the **UI** was built using the [alpine](https://alpinejs.dev/) framework
since the app doesn't use a lot of javascript. The styling was made using
**plain css** (yes, complicated) and somehow I manage to made it look great ;)
